<!-- ===== BRIEF NARRATIVE ===== -->
<div class="brief-content reveal">

  <p>Japan's most respected companies don't measure history in quarters — they measure it in centuries. When Slalom Build opened its Tokyo office, the opportunity was unlike anything in the firm's global portfolio: heritage enterprises that had survived wars, earthquakes, and economic upheavals now facing a digital transformation they couldn't navigate alone. These weren't startups looking for product-market fit. They were institutions looking for a bridge between craft and code.</p>

  <p>My role was building that bridge. As Director of Experience Design, I oversaw UX strategy across the entire Japan practice — setting the design vision for every client engagement, hiring and mentoring the experience team, and ensuring that Slalom Build's product engineering methodology translated across cultural and industry boundaries. The work spanned five enterprise clients, each representing a different frontier of innovation.</p>

  <!-- ===== JRCS ===== -->
  <h3>JRCS — From Waterfall to Autonomy</h3>

  <div class="inline-image inline-image--dark" data-kanji="海" data-label="JRCS · Autonomous Vessel Decision Support System">
    <img src="../img/library/slalom/084-shibuya-crossing-night.jpg" alt="JRCS autonomous vessel digital innovation — Slalom Build Japan" loading="lazy">
    <span class="inline-image__label">JRCS · Autonomous Vessel Decision Support System</span>
  </div>

  <p>JRCS is a 70-year-old marine hardware company based in Shimonoseki — a city where you can still see fishing boats leave harbour at dawn the way they have for generations. The company manufactures control panels and engine monitoring systems for vessels. Their CEO, Koichiro Kondo, had a vision far beyond hardware: a "digital captain" that could assist — and eventually replace — the crushing watch-keeping duties that burn out ship captains and drive young people away from maritime careers.</p>

  <p>Slalom Build deployed a team directly to Shimonoseki. I led the experience design for what would become "command" — a computer vision product that detects objects at sea from an array of three cameras, day or night, identifying small vessels, buoys, and drifting objects invisible to traditional radar. The UX challenge was designing for a user who can never look away from the ocean. Every interaction had to be peripheral, ambient, trustworthy — the opposite of the attention-hungry interfaces we build on land.</p>

  <p>We delivered a working decision support product in nine months — faster than anyone else in the industry. JRCS went from a hardware company developing simple software in a waterfall process to an AI innovator with an agile engineering team and a partnership with Microsoft on mixed reality and edge computing. Their roadmap now targets full autonomous multi-vessel control from land by 2030.</p>

  <p class="pull-quote">The hardest design problem wasn't the AI — it was earning the trust of captains who've navigated by instinct for thirty years. You don't replace intuition with a dashboard. You extend it.</p>

  <!-- ===== KAWASAKI ===== -->
  <h3>Kawasaki Heavy Industries — Intelligence on the Rails</h3>

  <p>The United States has 130,000 miles of railroad track spread across 3.8 million square miles. Keeping it safe has always been a labour-intensive process: dedicated inspection cars that interrupt freight operations, highly trained inspectors who must visually identify hairline defects in fasteners, ties, and ballast, and meticulous documentation under federal safety regulations. More than 1,000 train incidents occur every year.</p>

  <p>Kawasaki — a company with over a century of heavy industry heritage — saw an opportunity to change that equation entirely. They partnered with Slalom Build to create an intelligent track maintenance platform powered by computer vision and machine learning. The "Fastener" system uses edge-deployed AI to inspect every spike, clamp, and clip against both railroad and Federal Railroad Administration rules. The "Maintenance Advisor" compiles repair needs and plans optimised routes — minimising cost and disruption across the entire rail network.</p>

  <p>The cross-border collaboration was a defining experience. Key Kawasaki engineers travelled to the Seattle Build Center for Discovery, where we shaped the product vision together. Then we built the internal capability: Kawasaki went from zero software engineers to a team of 12–15, successfully delivering working software using agile methodology — a transformation as significant as the product itself. The platform is now being field-tested by Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, with revenue potential in the tens of millions.</p>

  <p class="pull-quote">When a century-old heavy manufacturer builds its first software team, the design challenge isn't the interface — it's the organisation. You're designing a new way of working, not just a new product.</p>

  <!-- ===== TAKENAKA ===== -->
  <h3>Takenaka Corporation — 400 Years of Building, Reimagined</h3>

  <div class="inline-image" data-kanji="建" data-label="Takenaka Corporation · Founded 1610 · Agile Transformation">
    <img src="../img/library/slalom/082-akihabara-neon.jpg" alt="Takenaka Corporation digital transformation — Japan's oldest architectural firm" loading="lazy">
    <span class="inline-image__label">Takenaka Corporation · Founded 1610 · Agile Transformation</span>
  </div>

  <p>Takenaka Corporation was founded in 1610 — sixteen years before the Taj Mahal was commissioned. For four centuries and seventeen generations of family leadership, they've built some of Japan's most iconic structures: Tokyo Tower, Narita Airport's first terminal, the Tokyo Dome, Fukuoka Dome, and Abeno Harukas — Japan's tallest building. They are one of the "Big Five" general contractors and a stakeholder in Kansai Airports, the operator of the engineering marvel built on an artificial island in Osaka Bay.</p>

  <p>Yet construction industry productivity in Japan had remained flat for twenty years. An aging skilled workforce and a shortage of young talent made digital transformation existential, not optional. Slalom Build's engagement with Takenaka focused on something more fundamental than technology: adopting Agile methodology in an industry that had never worked that way.</p>

  <p>The cultural shift was captured in a phrase that became Takenaka's new philosophy: "Throw out what you don't need." From a 400-year-old company rooted in the toryo tradition — where the master builder takes full responsibility for every detail — this was a profound reframing. We helped them build a digital construction platform on AWS with AI, IoT, and digital twin capabilities, but the lasting impact was methodological: a company that survived four centuries learned to iterate in two-week sprints.</p>

  <!-- ===== BANDAI NAMCO ===== -->
  <h3>Bandai Namco — 45 Years of IP Become a World</h3>

  <div class="inline-image inline-image--dark" data-kanji="宇" data-label="SIDE-G · Gundam Metaverse Virtual Space Colony">
    <img src="../img/discovery/slalom/gundam-metaverse-kv.jpg" alt="Gundam Metaverse SIDE-G virtual space colony — Bandai Namco" loading="lazy">
    <span class="inline-image__label">SIDE-G · Gundam Metaverse Virtual Space Colony</span>
  </div>

  <p>When a beloved IP becomes a place — not a show, not a game, but a world fans inhabit — the design questions change fundamentally. Bandai Namco invested $130M to build SIDE-G, a series of virtual space colonies where 45 years of Gundam heritage becomes a world fans step into. Navigation isn't a menu — it's spatial wayfinding through colony clusters mapped to distinct eras of the franchise.</p>

  <p>My role was defining the UX strategy that makes a fan feel like a pilot, not a visitor. We started with fan mental models — the federations, the colony clusters, the allegiances that Gundam fans have internalised over decades — and built the information architecture around those existing loyalties, not around generic virtual world conventions. The avatar system was designed as an identity object: fans earn affiliation markers, suit insignia, and colony access rights through engagement, mirroring the hero arc Gundam stories have always told.</p>

  <p>Cross-media continuity was the hardest UX problem. SIDE-G had to coexist with 45 years of anime, manga, Gunpla kits, games, and concerts — without contradicting any of it. We designed entry points keyed to different fan types: the lore completionist, the builder, the social fan, the newcomer. Each path leads to the same world but through a different gate.</p>

  <p class="pull-quote">An IP-native virtual world doesn't start with technology — it starts with the mythology fans already carry. Design your world to honour what they already believe.</p>

  <!-- ===== CTC ===== -->
  <h3>CTC (Itochu Techno-Solutions) — The Multiplier Effect</h3>

  <p>The most powerful outcome of a consulting engagement isn't the product you build — it's the capability you leave behind. CTC, Japan's leading IT services company under the Itochu Corporation umbrella, sent seven engineers to the Seattle Build Center to learn Slalom Build's Product Engineering Methodology firsthand. Together, we built a real-time translation application on AWS serverless architecture — but the application was a vehicle, not the goal.</p>

  <p>The real delivery was knowledge transfer at organisational scale. CTC's engineers experienced agile product development from the inside: cross-functional teams, continuous integration, design thinking embedded in engineering sprints. They learned how organisational structure — not just technical skill — provides increased agility, velocity, and camaraderie. When they returned to Tokyo, CTC established their own Build Center service in Japan, extending Slalom's methodology into their own client engagements. One team became many.</p>

  <!-- ===== PRACTICE & CULTURE ===== -->
  <h3>Building the Practice</h3>

  <p>Slalom Build opened the Tokyo office in late 2022 with a clear thesis: bring cutting-edge product engineering to a market where software development had been established for decades but the methodology was outdated. The team we built was international from day one — builders from seven countries, using English as their common language, with a deliberate commitment to diversity and inclusion that challenged Japanese corporate norms.</p>

  <p>The engagements described above share a common thread: heritage companies whose centuries of domain expertise needed a new expression in software. In each case, the design challenge went beyond interfaces. It was about organisational transformation — helping companies that had mastered physical craft learn to think in iterations, ship in increments, and trust the process of building something they couldn't fully specify in advance. The frontier wasn't the technology. It was the culture.</p>
