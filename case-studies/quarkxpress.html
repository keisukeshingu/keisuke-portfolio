<!-- ===== BRIEF NARRATIVE ===== -->
<div class="brief-content reveal">

  <h3>Who Quark Was</h3>
  <p>At its peak, Quark owned the professional publishing market. Not a majority — virtually all of it. Every newspaper, magazine, advertising agency, and book publisher ran production through QuarkXPress. On the Mac platform, Quark was consistently one of the top three third-party developers — alongside Adobe and Macromedia. Designers, prepress operators, and art directors didn't choose QuarkXPress. It was simply the tool. Adobe built InDesign specifically to challenge that dominance — and staffed the project by hiring software architects directly from Quark.</p>

  <p>Quark shipped over 30 language versions and more than 5 million licenses were active worldwide — every one of them requiring a hardware dongle to run. Publishing ran on Quark and Mac. Steve Jobs cared deeply about typography and design, and that shared DNA between Apple and the publishing industry defined the era. The transition from Mac OS 9 to OS X was the most significant platform shift Apple ever made — and for professional publishing, it meant every production pipeline and every XTension had to be rebuilt from scratch. I see my career as part of that evolution of publishing technology, alongside Apple and Adobe.</p>

  <h3>Japanese Typography & Publishing Partners</h3>
  <p>I joined the Product Management and UI group, writing functional requirements for Japanese typography and complex layout features. The work meant direct working sessions with Japan's leading publishers — newspapers, magazines, books — defining how Kanji line-end justification, vertical text columns, ruby text alignment, and CJK spacing rules should behave. These requirements didn't exist in any published standard. They were specified in the room, with the people whose production depended on getting them right.</p>

  <p>Seeing is believing: the requirement is done when the publisher across the table reads it and nods.</p>

      <span class="inline-image__label">QuarkXPress Layout Engine · The Publishing Standard</span>
    </div>

  <h3>Macworld</h3>
  <p>I designed the product demo presentations for Macworld — the event where the creative industry came to see what Quark was shipping next. The demos ran on new features that were still full of bugs and crashes. That was part of the job. I enjoyed it — building real designs using capabilities that didn't fully exist yet: layers, transparency, tables, truly object-based interactive layout.</p>

  <p>The era was chaotic. The browser wars were in full swing — Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, Safari — and web design wouldn't stabilise until Chrome arrived. In that environment, showing a room full of dreamers and visionaries a working demo of where professional design was heading next was exciting.</p>

    </div>

  <h3>SVG Research</h3>
  <p>At the Research Lab, I joined Quark's internal SVG committee — because I saw the future in vector graphics. Scalable, resolution-independent, transformable by code. Not bitmaps. The future spec of interactive design was forming around this time, and SVG was at its core.</p>

  <p>Two decades later, SVG is everywhere — icons, animation, data visualisation, generative art. And with modern JavaScript animation frameworks and Web3, the opportunity that Quark Interactive Designer opened is ready to be built again — a new generation of non-coding interactive design tools, natively on the web.</p>

  <h3>Quark Interactive Designer</h3>
  <p>QuarkImmedia (1996) was Quark's first bridge from print layout to interactive publishing — ahead of its time, but the web wasn't ready. By the mid-2000s, Flash had become the standard for interactive content, yet it was still a developer's tool, not a designer's.</p>

  <p>I was chosen to lead the remake. Quark Interactive Designer: I remapped the entire feature set from scratch — what stayed, what was cut, what was new — and defined every interaction for a designer who knew QuarkXPress but had never written a line of ActionScript. The result exported fully interactive Flash content directly from XPress's layout environment. No timeline. No code.</p>

  <p>Quark Interactive Designer won Best of Show at MacExpo 2006.</p>

      <span class="inline-image__label">Quark Interactive Designer · Best of Show · MacExpo 2006</span>
    </div>

  <p>Quark is where I earned my green card. Everything that followed in the United States started here.</p>
