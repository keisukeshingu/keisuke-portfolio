<!-- ===== BRIEF NARRATIVE ===== -->
<div class="brief-content reveal">

  <h3>The Platform</h3>
  <p>At its peak, Quark owned the professional publishing market. Not a majority — virtually all of it. Every newspaper, magazine, ad agency, and book publisher ran production through QuarkXPress. On the Mac platform, Quark stood alongside Adobe and Macromedia as one of the top three third-party developers. Designers and art directors didn't choose it. It was simply the tool — and Adobe built InDesign specifically to unseat it, staffing the project by poaching architects directly from Quark.</p>

  <p>Quark shipped in over 30 languages. More than 5 million licenses were active worldwide, every one locked to a hardware dongle. Steve Jobs understood typography and design at a foundational level, and that shared DNA between Apple and the publishing world defined the era. The OS 9 to OS X transition was the most consequential platform shift professional publishing had ever faced: every workflow, every production pipeline, every XTension rebuilt from scratch. I see my work at Quark as part of that arc — the evolution of publishing technology running in parallel with Apple and Adobe.</p>

  <h3>Japanese Typography</h3>
  <p>In the Product Management and UI group, I wrote functional requirements for Japanese typography — working directly with Japan's leading publishers to define how QuarkXPress should handle the complexities of the written language. Kanji line-end justification. Vertical text flow. Ruby text alignment above base characters. CJK spacing rules between mixed scripts. None of these existed in any published specification. They were defined in working sessions, face to face with the editors and production managers whose print runs depended on getting every detail right.</p>

  <p>Before QuarkXPress, Japanese publishers ran on phototypesetting machines like the Morisawa MC-6 — precision analog hardware where a trained operator set type physically, one character at a time. QuarkXPress replaced that entire workflow with screen-based layout. The leap wasn't just technical. It changed how Japanese publishers thought about time, iteration, and what a layout could be.</p>

  <p class="pull-quote">The requirement is done when the publisher across the table reads it and nods.</p>

    </div>

  <h3>Macworld & Seybold</h3>
  <p>I designed product demo presentations for Macworld and Seybold — the two stages where the creative industry came to see what Quark was shipping next. The demos ran on features that were still crashing. That was part of the job. Building real layouts using capabilities that didn't fully exist yet: layers, transparency, tables, truly object-based interactive content. You were showing the audience what publishing would feel like — not just what the software could do today.</p>

  <p>This was an era of maximum creative tension. Browser wars, competing standards, no settled platform for the web. Professional design had a home — print — but everyone in that room at Moscone could feel the ground shifting. Presenting a working demo of where layout was heading next, to a room full of people who had dedicated their careers to it, was one of the more honest things I've done professionally.</p>

  <h3>The Design Ecosystem</h3>
  <div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:1fr 200px; gap:2rem; align-items:start; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
    <div>
      <p>QuarkXPress created more than a market — it created a culture. Thousands of production-ready templates circulated through the professional design community, built on precise typographic grids inside XPress. Publishers like StockLayouts codified best practices for brochures, catalogs, annual reports, and editorial layouts that designers could adapt, study, and build on. The templates weren't shortcuts. They were a shared design education.</p>
      <p>At the intellectual center of that culture sat Josef Müller-Brockmann's <em>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</em> (1981). The principles it codified — modular grids, mathematical proportion, asymmetric balance — became the invisible architecture behind every serious XPress layout. Designers applied Müller-Brockmann whether they'd read him or not. Setting up column guides, baseline grids, and master pages in QuarkXPress was Swiss design thinking in practice, every day, at every publishing desk in the world.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Designer</h3>
  <p>My work in the Research Lab started with SVG — I joined Quark's internal SVG committee because I saw where design was heading. Vector graphics: scalable, resolution-independent, transformable by code. Not bitmaps. The future spec of interactive design was crystallising around this standard, and the implications for layout tools were clear.</p>

  <p>That research led directly to Quark Interactive Designer. QuarkImmedia (1996) had been Quark's first attempt at interactive publishing — too early, the web wasn't ready. By the mid-2000s, Flash had become the de facto standard for interactive content, but it was still a developer's environment, not a designer's. I was chosen to lead the remake.</p>

  <p>I remapped the entire feature set from scratch — what stayed, what was cut, what was genuinely new — and defined every interaction model for a designer who knew QuarkXPress but had never written a line of ActionScript. The result: fully interactive Flash content exported directly from XPress's layout environment. No timeline editor. No code. A designer's tool.</p>

  <p>Quark Interactive Designer won Best of Show at MacExpo UK 2006.</p>

  <p>Quark is where I earned my green card. Everything that came after in the United States started here.</p>
